- Distributed Systems:
    - A set of cooperating computers that communicate over a network to work
    coherently. Eg: storage for big websites, P2P, map reduce
    - Gains from Distributed system
        - Parallelism
        - Fault Tolerance
        - Some problems have natural affinity to use distributed systems
        - Security and isolation
    - Difficulties with Distributed system
        - Failures are difficult to detect, (Network or nodes)
        - Complicated Concurrent Programming problems
        - Performance
    - Infrastructure for distributed systems:
        - Storage : Example: HDFS (Distributed File system)
        - Communications : Example: RPC
        - Computations : Example : Map Reduce (Computation system)
    - Ideal to have non distributed abstractions that hide underlying distributed architecture
    - Implementation
        - RPC
        - Threads (way of structuring concurrent operations)
        - Concurrency control
    - Performance in distributed systems
        - Scalable speedup
        - Adding more machines decreases problem solving time
    - Fault Tolerance
