Scalable databases:
  - data storage capcity
  - data lifecycle, how long the data is going to stay
  - data accesibility (read and writes)
  - available and reliable

Questions:
  - Nature of data? structured, documents, free flowing like text
  - Volume of data? Total volumn, rate of ingestion, rate of growth, lifecycle
  - Usage of data:
      - Transaction =>  ACID is important
      - Monitoring & Compliancec => Query is not important
      - Analytics => Query is most important

A view of data modelling:
  - Identify domain specific entities
  - Model how entities relate - (One to One, Many to One, Many to Many etc)
  - Attributes of entities, (things help to identify the entity)
  - Plan for changes in entity relationship

How muchh data?:
  - What domain events lead to generation of new data
  - Expected rate of growth in data generation
  - Over time will the data be aggregated or reduced

How is data used?:
  - Interactive transaction in support of domain event or process
  - Decision making
  - Anamoly detection

Use cases of data?:
  - Examples
    - sales transaction data for fullfilling orders
    - geolocation data for triggering offers based on location of users
  - Data may be used in future as well as immediately upon collection/ingestion
  - Use case leads to workloads
    - how data is generated, ingested, stored
    - how data is reported, analyzed and visualized
  - Access Patterns (examples):
      - Read/Write intensive => Ex, Transaction processing, need low latency and works on small data
      - Bulk load Intensive => Ex, Data Warehousing, ok with high latency and query vast data
      - Same data from a source can be used for decision making, transaction management, anomaly detection etc
      - Diverse datasets about customer like sales, web browsing, product reviews and demographics are analyzed to increase gross margin
      - Workloads
        - Driven by organization need for data
        - multi step
        - have dependencies

Security and Compliance:
  - Security:
      - Confidentiality, availability and integrity of data,
      - Focus on who can do what to which pieces of data
      - Confidentiality:
          - Principle of least privilege
          - Identity and Access Management
          - Encryption in on-transit and in-rest
          - Data loss prevention
      - Availability:
          - Replication of data
          - High recoverability with some recovert point objective
      - Integrity:
          - Calculating checkcum/ message digest
          - Data Audits

  - Compliance:
      - Institutional scrutiny
      - Governemnt rules on what we do with data
      - Dictates on our roles and responsibility with data
      - Sources of compliance:
          - Organization
          - Industry
          - Government organization like HIPAA and GDPR

Estimate data growth:
  - This influences data architecture, data model and costs
  - Growth factor depends on:
    - Number of users, sensors, customers and so on
    - New data sources, including external sources
    - Data lifecycle
    - Increased application use
    - New workloads, changes in business process, ETL that consume more data
    - Expanded data sources:
      - Human based
      - IOT based
      - Data augmentation using third party data sources
    - Data lifecycle management:
      - Not all data have same access pattern
      - Older data is less likely to be queries in case of timeseries/monitoring
      - Use of tiered storage, hot storage, nearline storage, cold line storage
      - When do you remove data from database and keep in lower cost object storage
