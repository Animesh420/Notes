HBase
    - Google big table was first blob based storage system
    - Yahoo open sourced it as HBase
    - HBase is a No SQL solution that support consistency over availability unlike Cassandra
    - API Functions
        - Get/ Pull (row)
        - Scan (row range, filter) - range queries
        - Multi Put
    -  HBase main players
        - Client - One who sends queries reads/writes to hbase system
        - Servers - One who answer to the client requests
        - The coordination between client and server is done by zookeeper which is a small group of servers
        running PAXOS like (ZAB protocol) consensus protocol
        - The HBase system has multiple HRegionServers
        - HRegionServers contain multiple HRegions
        - Hregions contain multiple stores
        - Each store contains multiple StoreFiles
        - Each store file contains a Hfile
        - HFile is stored in HDFS
        - Store contains a MemStore
        - HRegionServer has HLog
        - HMaster talks with zookeeper and can manage the HDFS
    - HBase table
        - Split into multiple regions, replicated across servers
        - Column Family = subset of column with similar query patterns
        - One store per combination of column family + region
            - MemStore: for each store, in-memory updates to the store, flushed to disk, when full
            - StoreFile: for each store for each region where the data lives
            - HFile : SSTable from Google's big table, similar to sstable in cassandra
    - HFile
